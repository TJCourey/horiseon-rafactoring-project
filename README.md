# horiseon-rafactoring-project

## Description

I am woirking on refactoring a clients webpage to make the code more concise, have better functionality, and have the webpage be more accessible.

- This is my first personal assignment and I hoped to test the skills I have been learning
- I did this as an example of the HTML and CSS skills I have picked up.
- This solves a number of problems including acessability, lack of comments and some minor functionality issues
- I learned a lot not only about the coding itself but also: git flow, consolidation of code, and peer review
